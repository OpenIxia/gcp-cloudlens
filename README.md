# GCP-CloudLens - Deployment examples for CloudLens network visibility software on Google Cloud Platform
## Overview

CloudLens is a software for intent-based multi-cloud network visibility, designed to:
* Enable SoC with control over traffic monitoring across any cloud
* Take advantage of rapid sensor deployment capabilities during incident response
* Extend reach of security detection tooling to edge workloads and inside Kubernetes clusters
* Reduce costs of running complex tooling infrastructure

When deployed on Google Cloud, CloudLens leverages and extends capabilities of the native [GCP Packet Mirroring service](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/packet-mirroring).
